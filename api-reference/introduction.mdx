## API Structure

- **Business**: Account management and merchant information
- **Payments**: Payment initiation, confirmation, and status queries
- **Accounts**: Virtual account creation and management
- **Recipients**: Payment recipient management
- **Webhooks**: Event management and delivery

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Request completed successfully",
  "stan": "unique-transaction-id",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

- `success`: Boolean indicating request success
- `message`: Human-readable response message
- `stan`: System Trace Audit Number (unique transaction identifier)
- `data`: Response payload (varies by endpoint)

## Error Handling

When an error occurs, the API returns an error response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "stan": "unique-transaction-id",
  "data": "Additional error details"
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:

- `200 OK`: Request successful
- `201 Created`: Resource created successfully
- `202 Accepted`: Request accepted for processing
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing authentication
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

## Rate Limits

API rate limits apply to prevent abuse. Check the response headers for rate limit information:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets
