title: 'Create Payment'
openapi: 'POST /payments/initiate'

Initiate a new payment transaction. This endpoint creates a payment quote that must be confirmed using the [Confirm Payment](/api-reference/payments/confirm-payment) endpoint.

## Overview

This endpoint starts a payment transaction by creating a payment quote. The quote includes fees, exchange rates, and total amount to collect. After reviewing the quote, you must call the confirm endpoint to execute the payment.

<Warning>
  Payments require a two-step process: first initiate to get a quote, then complete to execute the payment. Quotes expire after 5 minutes.
</Warning>

## Payment Flow

1. **Initiate Payment** - Call this endpoint with payment details to get a quote
2. **Review Quote** - Check the fees, exchange rates, and total amount
3. **Confirm Payment** - Use the `quote_id` and `reference` from the response to complete the payment

<Tip>
  Use the `Idempotency-Key` header to prevent duplicate payments if you need to retry the request.
