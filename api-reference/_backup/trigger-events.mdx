Manually trigger a webhook event to be sent again. This is useful for testing webhook endpoints or retrying failed webhook deliveries.

## Overview

This endpoint allows you to manually retrigger a webhook event. This is particularly useful when:

- Testing your webhook endpoint
- Retrying a failed webhook delivery
- Replaying an event for debugging purposes

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  Webhook event UUID to trigger
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  Trigger response containing:
  
  - `event_id`: The event ID that was triggered
  - `acknowledged`: Whether the event was acknowledged
  - `attempts`: Number of delivery attempts
  - `message`: Status message
</ResponseField>

<Note>
  Triggering an event will increment the attempt counter and send the webhook to your configured endpoint again.
