Prefunded float is a balance you maintain with Pooler to cover outgoing payments. This guide explains how prefunded float works, when it's required, and how to manage it effectively.

## What is Prefunded Float?

Prefunded float is a prepaid balance that you maintain in your Pooler account. When you initiate a payment, the funds are deducted from your float balance. This ensures that payments can be processed immediately without waiting for additional funding.

## When is Float Required?

Float is typically required for:

- **Outgoing Payments** - All payments you send to recipients require sufficient float balance
- **Currency Conversions** - When converting between currencies, float must cover the source currency amount plus fees
- **High-Volume Transactions** - Businesses processing many payments may need to maintain float for operational efficiency
