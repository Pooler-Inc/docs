Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that notify your application in real-time when events occur in your Pooler account. Instead of polling the API for updates, webhooks push event data to your server as events happen.

## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are HTTP POST requests sent by Pooler to a URL you specify when specific events occur. They allow your application to react immediately to events like payment completions, virtual account transactions, and errors.

## How Webhooks Work

### Webhook Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Event Occurs">
    An event occurs in your Pooler account (e.g., payment completed, virtual account payment received).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Webhook Triggered">
    Pooler prepares a webhook payload with event data.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="HTTP POST Request">
    Pooler sends an HTTP POST request to your webhook URL.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Your Server Receives">
    Your webhook endpoint receives and processes the request.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Response Sent">
    Your server responds with HTTP 200 to acknowledge receipt.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Retry if Failed">
    If your server doesn't respond or returns an error, Pooler retries the webhook 4 times before back-off.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Events

### Available Events

Pooler sends webhooks for various events:

| Category | Event Name | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Payment | `payment.initiated` | Payment quote created |
| Payment | `payment.completed` | Payment successfully processed |
| Payment | `payment.failed` | Payment processing failed |
| Payment | `payment.rejected` | Payment was rejected |
| Virtual Account | `virtual_account.payment_received` | Payment received in virtual account |
| Virtual Account | `virtual_account.created` | Virtual account created |
| Virtual Account | `virtual_account.updated` | Virtual account updated |
| Recipient | `recipient.created` | Recipient created |
| Recipient | `recipient.verified` | Recipient verification completed |
| Recipient | `recipient.verification_failed` | Recipient verification failed |
| Account | `account.balance_low` | Account balance below threshold |
| Account | `account.updated` | Account details updated |

  See the [Webhook Events API](/api-reference/webhooks/list-events) for a complete list of available events.

## Setting Up Webhooks

### Step 1: Create Webhook Endpoint

Create an HTTP endpoint in your application to receive webhooks:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
// Express.js example
app.post('/webhooks/pooler', async (req, res) => {
  const webhook = req.body;
  
  // Verify webhook signature
  if (!verifyWebhookSignature(req)) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }
  
  // Process webhook
  await processWebhook(webhook);
  
  // Respond quickly
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

```python Python
# Flask example
@app.route('/webhooks/pooler', methods=['POST'])
def handle_webhook():
    webhook = request.json
    
    # Verify webhook signature
    if not verify_webhook_signature(request):
        return 'Invalid signature', 401
    
    # Process webhook
    process_webhook(webhook)
    
    # Respond quickly
    return 'OK', 200
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Configure Webhook URL

Configure your webhook URL in the Pooler dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Developers**
2. Add your webhook URL
3. Select events you want to receive
4. Save configuration

### Step 3: Test Webhook

Use the [Trigger Events API](/api-reference/webhooks/trigger-events) to test your webhook endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.usepooler.com/webhooks/events/trigger/{event_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
