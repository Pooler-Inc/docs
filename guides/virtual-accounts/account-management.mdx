Effective virtual account management is essential for scaling your payment collection operations. This guide covers advanced management techniques, automation strategies, and best practices.

## Account Organization

### Naming Conventions

Establish clear naming conventions for easy identification:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Naming Examples
// Order-based naming
account_name: `Order-${orderId}-${customerName}`

// Customer-based naming
account_name: `Customer-${customerId}`

// Invoice-based naming
account_name: `Invoice-${invoiceNumber}`

// Campaign-based naming
account_name: `Campaign-${campaignId}-${donorName}`
```
</CodeGroup>

### Metadata Usage

Use metadata to store additional information:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "order_id": "ORD-12345",
    "customer_id": "CUST-67890",
    "invoice_number": "INV-001",
    "campaign_id": "CAM-2024-001",
    "reference": "custom-reference-123"
  }
}
```


## Account Status Management

### Status Types

- **Active** - Account is active and can receive payments
- **Inactive** - Account is inactive and cannot receive payments
- **Expired** - Account has expired (if expiration is configured)
- **Suspended** - Account is suspended (typically for compliance reasons)

### Status Monitoring

Monitor account status to ensure accounts are ready to receive payments:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Status Monitoring
async function checkAccountStatus(accountId) {
  const response = await poolerClient.get(`/accounts/virtual-accounts/${accountId}`);
  const account = response.data.data;
  
  if (!account.active) {
    // Handle inactive account
    console.warn(`Account ${accountId} is inactive`);
    // Optionally create a new account
  }
  
  return account;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices Summary

<Tip>
  **Create Accounts Proactively**:
  - Create accounts before payment is needed.
  - Store all relevant information in metadata for easy tracking.
  - Regularly check account status to ensure they're ready.
  - Automate payment matching and reconciliation processes.
