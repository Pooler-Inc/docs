Get up and running with Pooler in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through accessing your dashboard, configuring your API keys, setting up webhooks, and testing payments using our demo banking simulator.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Pooler account (sign up at [usepooler.com](https://usepooler.com))
- Access to your email for account verification
- Basic understanding of REST APIs

<Info>

## Step 1: Access Your Dashboard

The Pooler dashboard is your central hub for managing your account, viewing transactions, and configuring settings.

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Navigate to [app.usepooler.com](https://app.usepooler.com) or click "Dashboard" from the main website
2. Log in with your Pooler account credentials
3. If you don't have an account, click "Sign Up" to create one

### Dashboard Overview

Once logged in, you'll see:

- **Overview Dashboard** - Key metrics, recent transactions, and account balance
- **Transactions** - View and filter all payment transactions
- **Virtual Accounts** - Manage your virtual accounts
- **Recipients** - Manage payment recipients
- **Settings** - Configure account settings, API keys, and webhooks
- **Analytics** - View reports and analytics

<Tip>
  Bookmark the dashboard URL for quick access. You'll use it frequently to monitor transactions and manage your account.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Access the Developers Page

The Developers page is where you'll find your API keys, test credentials, and API documentation.

### Finding the Developers Page

1. From your dashboard, click on **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Navigate to **Developers** or **API Keys** section
3. Alternatively, you can access it directly at [app.usepooler.com/developers](https://app.usepooler.com/developers)

![Developers Page - API Keys](/images/developers-page.png)

### What You'll Find on the Developers Page

- **API Keys** - Your live and test API keys
- **Webhook Configuration** - Manage webhook endpoints
- **Test Credentials** - Demo accounts and test data
- **API Version** - Current API version information

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure. Never commit them to version control or share them publicly. Use environment variables in your application.
</Warning>

### Getting Your API Keys

1. On the Developers page, locate the **API Keys** section
2. You'll see two keys:
   - **Test Key** - For testing in sandbox mode (starts with `test_`)
   - **Live Key** - For production use (starts with `live_`)
3. Click **Show** or **Reveal** to view your API key
4. Click **Copy** to copy the key to your clipboard

<Info>
  Test keys are safe to use in development and testing environments. Live keys should only be used in production applications.
</Info>

## Webhook Security

Pooler signs all webhook requests with a secret key. Verify the signature to ensure requests are authentic:

1. Get your webhook secret from the Developers page
2. Verify the signature in your webhook handler
3. Reject requests with invalid signatures

<Warning>
  Always verify webhook signatures in production. This prevents unauthorized requests from being processed.
</Warning>

For detailed webhook security information, see our [Webhook Signature Security](/guides/webhooks/signature-security) guide.

## Step 3: Test with Demo Banking Simulator

Pooler provides a demo banking simulator that allows you to test payment flows without using real money or bank accounts.

### What is the Demo Banking Simulator?

The demo banking simulator is a testing environment that mimics real banking behavior, allowing you to:

- Test payment initiation and completion
- Simulate different payment scenarios (success, failure, pending)
- Test webhook notifications
- Verify your integration without financial risk

### Accessing the Demo Banking Simulator

1. From your dashboard, navigate to **Developers** → **Testing Tools**
2. Click on **Demo Banking Simulator** or **Test Environment**
3. You'll be redirected to the simulator interface
