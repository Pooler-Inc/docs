Payment recipients are the individuals or businesses that receive payments through Pooler. This guide explains what recipients are, how they work, and how to manage them effectively.

## What are Recipients?

Recipients are payees - the people or businesses you send money to through Pooler. Before you can send a payment, you must create a recipient record with their payment account details. Once created, you can reuse recipient records for multiple payments.
