Payments are the core functionality of Pooler. This guide provides an overview of how payments work, the payment process, and key concepts you need to understand.

## Payment Process

### Two-Step Payment Flow

Pooler uses a two-step payment process for transparency and control:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate Payment">
    Create a payment quote with fees and exchange rates.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Quote">
    Review the quote including:
    - Payment amount
    - Fees
    - Exchange rates (if applicable)
    - Total amount to deduct
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Payment">
    Confirm the payment to execute the transfer.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Processing">
    Pooler processes the payment through selected route.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Completion">
    Payment is completed and recipient receives funds.
  </Step>
</Steps>
