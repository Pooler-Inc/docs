Understanding transaction fees is essential for managing payment costs. This guide explains the different types of fees, how they're calculated, and how to optimize costs.

## Fee Types

### Transaction Fees

Fees charged per transaction:

- **Fixed Fee** - Fixed amount per transaction (e.g., $0.50)
- **Percentage Fee** - Percentage of transaction amount (e.g., 1%)
- **Tiered Fee** - Fee varies by amount tier
- **Hybrid Fee** - Combination of fixed and percentage

### Route Fees

Additional fees for specific payment routes:

- **Route-Specific** - Fees vary by payment route
- **Speed-Based** - Faster routes may have higher fees
- **Coverage-Based** - Some routes have additional fees

### Conversion Fees

Fees for currency conversion:

- **Conversion Fee** - Fee for converting between currencies
- **Spread** - Margin added to exchange rate
- **Combined** - May include both fixed and percentage components

## Fee Structure

### Fee Calculation

<img src="/images/fee-calculation-flow.png" alt="Fee Calculation Flow Diagram" />


**Example Calculation:**

```
Payment Amount: 1,000 NGN
Transaction Fee: 1% = 10 NGN
Route Fee: 5 NGN
Conversion Fee: 0 (same currency)

Total Fees: 10 + 5 = 15 NGN
Total Deduction: 1,000 + 15 = 1,015 NGN
```

**With Currency Conversion:**

```
Source Amount: 100 USD
Destination: 150,000 NGN (at 1,500 NGN/USD)
Transaction Fee: 1% = 1 USD
Conversion Fee: 0.1% = 0.1 USD
Route Fee: 0.5 USD

Total Fees: 1 + 0.1 + 0.5 = 1.6 USD
Total Deduction: 100 + 1.6 = 101.6 USD
```

## Fee Transparency

### Fee Disclosure

All fees are disclosed in payment quotes:

```json
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "NGN",
  "fees": {
    "transaction_fee": 10,
    "route_fee": 5,
    "conversion_fee": 0,
    "total_fees": 15
  },
  "total_amount": 1015,
  "fee_breakdown": {
    "transaction_fee": {
      "type": "percentage",
      "rate": 0.01,
      "amount": 10
    },
    "route_fee": {
      "type": "fixed",
      "amount": 5
    }
  }
}
```

### Fee Information Sources

Fees are available in:

- **Payment Quotes** - Complete fee breakdown
- **API Responses** - Fee details in responses
- **Dashboard** - Fee information in transaction history
- **Transaction Records** - Fees recorded in all transactions

## Fee Factors

### Factors Affecting Fees

**Payment Amount**
- Larger amounts may have different fee structures
- Some fees are percentage-based
- Minimum fees may apply

**Payment Route**
- Different routes have different fees
- Faster routes may cost more
- Route-specific fees apply

**Currency Conversion**
- Conversion adds conversion fees
- Spread may vary by currency pair
- Conversion fees are separate from transaction fees

**Payment Type**
- Different payment types may have different fees
- Local vs cross-border fees differ
- Route selection affects fees

## Fee Optimization

### Cost Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Route Optimization**

Choose cost-effective routes:

- Compare route fees
- Use cheaper routes when speed isn't critical
- Optimize route selection for cost

**Strategy 2: Bulk Payments**

Process payments in bulk:

- May qualify for volume discounts
- Reduce per-transaction overhead
- Optimize route usage

**Strategy 3: Currency Management**

Optimize currency conversions:

- Minimize conversions when possible
- Time conversions for favorable rates
- Use direct currency pairs when available

**Strategy 4: Payment Timing**

Time payments strategically:

- Avoid peak-time fees if applicable
- Process during cost-effective periods
- Batch payments for efficiency

## Fee Estimation

### Estimate Fees Before Payment

Use payment quotes to estimate fees:

```javascript
// Get fee estimate
const quote = await poolerClient.post('/payments/initiate', {
  amount: 1000,
  currency: 'NGN',
  recipient_id: recipientId
});

const fees = quote.data.data.fees;
console.log('Estimated Fees:', fees.total_fees);
console.log('Total Amount:', quote.data.data.total_amount);
```

### Fee Calculator

Calculate fees for planning:

- Use API to get quotes for different amounts
- Compare fees across different scenarios
- Plan payment costs in advance

## Fee Models

### Model 1: Pay-as-You-Go

Pay fees per transaction:

- **Pros:** No upfront costs, pay only for usage
- **Cons:** Fees per transaction, may be higher for high volume
- **Best For:** Low to medium volume, variable usage

### Model 2: Volume-Based

Fees reduce with volume:

- **Pros:** Lower fees at higher volumes, cost savings
- **Cons:** May require minimum volumes
- **Best For:** High volume, consistent usage

### Model 3: Subscription

Monthly fee with reduced transaction fees:

- **Pros:** Predictable costs, lower per-transaction fees
- **Cons:** Fixed monthly cost, may not be cost-effective for low volume
- **Best For:** Consistent high volume, predictable usage

## Fee Tracking

### Track Fees Over Time

Monitor fee trends:

- **Total Fees** - Track total fees paid
- **Average Fee** - Calculate average fee per transaction
- **Fee Trends** - Identify fee trends over time
- **Cost Analysis** - Analyze costs by route, currency, etc.

### Fee Reporting

Generate fee reports:

- **Transaction Reports** - Fees per transaction
- **Periodic Reports** - Fees by period (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Category Reports** - Fees by category (route, currency, etc.)
- **Comparison Reports** - Compare fees across periods

## Fee Reconciliation

### Reconcile Fees

Reconcile fees with transactions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Collect Fee Data">
    Gather fee data from:
    - Payment quotes
    - Transaction records
    - API responses
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Calculate Expected Fees">
    Calculate expected fees based on:
    - Payment amounts
    - Fee structures
    - Routes used
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Compare with Actual">
    Compare expected fees with actual fees charged.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Investigate Discrepancies">
    Investigate any discrepancies:
    - Verify fee calculations
    - Check for fee changes
    - Contact support if needed
  </Step>
</Steps>
