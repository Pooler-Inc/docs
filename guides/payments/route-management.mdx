Payment routes are the paths that payments take from your account to recipient accounts. Pooler automatically selects optimal routes, but understanding route management helps you optimize costs and processing times.

## What are Payment Routes?

Payment routes are the payment networks and channels used to transfer funds. Different routes have different characteristics:

- **Processing Speed** - How fast payments are processed
- **Cost** - Fees associated with the route
- **Reliability** - Success rate of the route
- **Coverage** - Countries and banks supported

## Route Types

### Local Routes

Routes for payments within the same country:

| Route Type | Speed | Cost | Coverage | Use Case |
|------------|-------|------|----------|----------|
| **NIP (Nigeria Instant Payment)** | Instant to minutes | Low | Nigerian banks | Local Nigerian transfers |
| **Local Bank Transfers** | Minutes to hours | Low to medium | Local banks | Standard local transfers |
| **Mobile Money** | Instant to minutes | Low | Mobile money networks | Mobile money transfers |

### Cross-Border Routes

Routes for international payments:

| Route Type | Speed | Cost | Coverage | Use Case |
|------------|-------|------|----------|----------|
| **SWIFT** | 1-5 business days | Medium to high | Global | International wire transfers |
| **Regional Networks** | Hours to days | Medium | Regional (e.g., SEPA, ACH) | Regional transfers |
| **Corridor-Specific Routes** | Varies by corridor | Optimized for specific corridors | Specific country pairs | High-volume corridors |

## Route Selection

### Automatic Route Selection

Pooler automatically selects the best route based on:


**Factors Considered:**

1. **Destination** - Recipient country and bank
2. **Amount** - Payment amount (some routes have minimums/maximums)
3. **Currency** - Source and destination currencies
4. **Speed Requirements** - Processing time needs
5. **Cost Optimization** - Balance between speed and cost
6. **Route Availability** - Current route status and capacity

### Route Selection Algorithm

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Available Routes">
    Determine all routes that can handle the payment based on destination, currency, and amount.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Filter by Requirements">
    Filter routes based on:
    - Speed requirements
    - Cost constraints
    - Route availability
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Score Routes">
    Score each route based on:
    - Cost (lower is better)
    - Speed (faster is better)
    - Reliability (higher success rate is better)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Optimal Route">
    Select the route with the best score for the payment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Route Optimization

### Cost Optimization

Optimize routes for cost:

- **Route Comparison** - Compare costs across available routes
- **Bulk Routing** - Use cost-effective routes for bulk payments
- **Time-Based Routing** - Use cheaper routes when speed isn't critical


### Speed Optimization

Optimize routes for speed:

- **Priority Routes** - Use fastest routes for urgent payments
- **Route Selection** - Prefer instant/same-day routes
- **Time-Based Selection** - Consider processing times when selecting routes


### Balanced Optimization

Balance cost and speed:

- **Tiered Routing** - Use fast routes for small amounts, cost-effective for large
- **Business Rules** - Apply business-specific routing rules
- **Dynamic Selection** - Adjust based on current conditions

## Route Information

### Getting Route Information

Route information is included in payment quotes:

```javascript
const quote = await poolerClient.post('/payments/initiate', paymentData);
const routeInfo = quote.data.data.route;

console.log('Route:', routeInfo.name);
console.log('Estimated Time:', routeInfo.estimated_time);
console.log('Route Fee:', routeInfo.fee);
```

### Route Details

Route information includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Route Name** | Identifier for the route |
| **Estimated Time** | Expected processing time |
| **Route Fee** | Fee for using this route |
| **Route Type** | Local or cross-border |
| **Currency Support** | Supported currencies |

## Route Management Strategies

### Strategy 1: Automatic Selection

Let Pooler automatically select routes:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Pros** | No configuration needed<br/>Always uses optimal route<br/>Adapts to changing conditions |
| **Cons** | Less control over routing<br/>May not match specific business needs |
| **When to Use** | Standard payment requirements<br/>Don't need route control<br/>Want simplicity |

### Strategy 2: Route Preferences

Specify route preferences when available:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Pros** | Control over routing<br/>Optimize for specific needs<br/>Balance cost and speed |
| **Cons** | Requires configuration<br/>May need updates over time |
| **When to Use** | Specific routing requirements<br/>Cost or speed optimization needs<br/>Business-specific rules |

### Strategy 3: Route Monitoring

Monitor route performance and adjust:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Pros** | Data-driven decisions<br/>Continuous optimization<br/>Identify issues early |
| **Cons** | Requires monitoring setup<br/>Need analysis capabilities |
| **When to Use** | High payment volumes<br/>Need optimization<br/>Want performance insights |


## Route Performance

### Monitoring Route Performance

Track route performance metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Success Rate** | Percentage of successful payments |
| **Average Processing Time** | Mean time to complete |
| **Cost per Payment** | Average cost per payment |
| **Error Rate** | Percentage of failed payments |

### Route Analytics

Analyze route data to optimize:

| Analysis Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Route Comparison** | Compare routes side-by-side |
| **Trend Analysis** | Identify trends over time |
| **Cost Analysis** | Understand cost patterns |
| **Performance Trends** | Track performance changes |


## Route Failures

### Handling Route Failures

When a route fails:

1. **Automatic Retry** - Pooler may automatically retry with alternative route
2. **Manual Retry** - You can manually retry the payment
3. **Route Selection** - New route may be selected for retry
4. **Notification** - You receive notification of route failure

### Route Failure Reasons

Common reasons for route failures:

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Route Unavailable** | Route temporarily unavailable |
| **Bank Rejection** | Recipient bank rejected payment |
| **Compliance Issues** | Compliance-related rejections |
| **Network Issues** | Payment network problems |
| **Invalid Details** | Incorrect recipient details |

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  - Pooler's automatic route selection is optimized for most use cases.
  - Track route performance to identify optimization opportunities.
  - Balance cost and speed based on your needs.
  - Implement retry logic for route failures.
  - Reach out for route optimization for high-volume scenarios.
