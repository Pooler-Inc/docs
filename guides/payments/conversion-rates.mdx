When sending payments in different currencies, Pooler handles currency conversion using real-time or quoted exchange rates. This guide explains how conversion rates work and how to manage them effectively.

## What are Conversion Rates?

Conversion rates determine how much of one currency you get for another currency. When you send a payment in a different currency, Pooler converts your source currency to the destination currency at the applicable rate.

## How Conversion Works

### Conversion Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Payment Initiation">
    You initiate a payment specifying:
    - Source amount (in your currency)
    - Destination currency (recipient's currency)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rate Quotation">
    Pooler provides:
    - Exchange rate for conversion
    - Destination amount (converted amount)
    - Conversion fee (if applicable)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rate Lock">
    Rate may be locked for a period (typically 5 minutes for quotes)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Conversion Execution">
    When payment is confirmed, conversion is executed at the quoted rate.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.response?.data?.message?.includes('expired')) {
    // Get new quote

    // Confirm with new quote
    await poolerClient.post('/payments/complete', {
      quote_id: newQuote.data.data.quote_id,
